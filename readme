To install:

Simple download these files to your webserver's root directory (/var/www/ for most webservers, see your apache config files)
All javascript files and css have been included

You will need an accuweather api key for this application to run. You can get one by signing up for an account and creating an app
at https://developer.accuweather.com/user/me/apps. Click on the app name after creating it and your api key will be displayed. Copy
and paste that key into line 10 of api/api.php

Example:

    public const apiKey = "<your api key here>";

Enjoy!
